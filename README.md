# General Info

Code is responsible for computing big large numbers.

Consider this:

If you want to compute `25!` in what type would you save it?
`Int` is too small. `Long` is also too small, and here we are. This is our problem we want to defeat. There is no as big type as we need to have to keep result of this computation.

This code gives you possibility to compute multiplication of big numbers.
